An **interactive, self-learning guessing game** built in C with a GUI powered by **Raylib** and **RayGUI**. The game challenges players to think of an item (course, club, car, etc.), then narrows down guesses through yes/no questions. If the game guesses wrong, it learns from the player by adding new questions â€” becoming smarter over time.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Multiple Modes**: Course, Country, Programming Language, Football Club, Car, plus **Custom Mode Creation**
- **Dynamic Learning**: Learns new questions and answers for future sessions
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Compete with friends; highest score wins
- **Undo Functionality**: Go back to the previous question
- **Timer**: Tracks the time taken per round
- **Tree Printing**: Visualize the decision tree structure
- **GUI Enhancements**:  
  - Custom backgrounds and themes per mode  
  - Interactive buttons, emojis, and sound effects  
  - Volume control via settings
